        This is Pute. She is my best friend, and also a dear friend to many of us. We met during our time as Entrepreneurship students at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Together, we started a stationery business called Creative Monkeys as part of a mandatory activity in our major. We spent a lot of time together during those years, and eventually grew closer, forming a strong friendship along with Elsa and Zahra. Back then, we loved riding bikes together.
      </p>
      <p>
        One memory that sticks with me is when we were standing in Eititu, a restaurant in CC Timur, and saw Nicholas Saputra ride past on his bike. We were too stunned by his charm to say a single word, and ended up saying nothing at all although we really wanted to say hi.
      </p>

        Pute has always loved art. At the time, she often said she wished she could study at FSRD. I am so proud of her for finally making that dream come true. Today she is an art student at Pratt Institute in New York.

        We used to visit art stores together and often went to art bazaars. Thanks to her, I discovered many amazing Indonesian artists. One of her favourites is alvinxki.

        Pute loves Totoro from Studio Ghibli. She loves cats. She cares deeply about womenâ€™s empowerment, womenâ€™s rights, and Free Palestine. She is empathetic and always cares for people. Iâ€™m glad that in New York she is also surrounded by female friends who remind her of the ones she has in Indonesia. I truly believe that when you are kind, you attract kind people.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past eight years, she has been a friend who stays through the good times and the curveballs life throws. Itâ€™s a luxury to have a friend like her, who genuinely listens and supports you through the tough times, and celebrates with you in the good ones without envy. Not only does she accept me as I am, but she also pushes me to grow into a better person. Sheâ€™s the reason I still believe in humanity, and her presence in my life makes it all worth living.

        Congratulations on revolving around the sun 27 times, @puteriatf!

        Whether we were just a meter apart in classes at Ganesha and Jatinangor, a hundred and fifty kilometres apart when I worked in Jakarta while you stayed in Bandung, or sixteen thousand kilometres apart between Jakarta and New York City, your love and presence have always been felt.
      </p>

        Thank you for being the light that guides me through the tunnel.<br>
        Thank you for being the star that softens the night.<br>
        Thank you for being the kind and beautiful soul that you are.
